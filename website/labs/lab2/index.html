  <h2>Lab Q&amp;A</h2>

  <p>We encourage you to ask questions on course's <a href=
  "https://piazza.com/technion.ac.il/spring2017/236376">Piazza
  Q&amp;A forum</a>. If no help provided on Piazza forum then try to
  email TA in charge. E-mails regarding this lab (such as
  administrative issues) should be sent with the subject "OSE 2017,
  lab2".</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In this lab, you will write the memory management code for your
  operating system. Memory management has two components.</p>

  <p>The first component is a physical memory allocator for the
  kernel, so that the kernel can allocate memory and later free it.
  Your allocator will operate in units of 4096 bytes, called
  <i>pages</i>. Your task will be to maintain data structures that
  record which physical pages are free and which are allocated, and
  how many processes are sharing each allocated page. You will also
  write the routines to allocate and free pages of memory.</p>

  <p>The second component of memory management is <i>virtual
  memory</i>, which maps the virtual addresses used by kernel and
  user software to addresses in physical memory. The x86 hardware's
  memory management unit (MMU) performs the mapping when instructions
  use memory, consulting a set of page tables. You will modify JOS to
  set up the MMU's page tables according to a specification we
  provide.</p>

  <h3>Getting started</h3>

  <p>You can consider adding your answers to lab 1 to git:</p>
  <pre>
$ <kbd>git add lab1-questionary.txt</kbd>
</pre>

  <p>Use the same syntax to add any new files to version control when
  needed. Note that <kbd>git commit</kbd> is required to finalize the
  adding (<kbd>git status</kbd> will tell you about all pending
  changes). Other commands you may find useful are <kbd>git
  diff</kbd>, <kbd>git gui</kbd>, <kbd>gitk</kbd> and <a href=
  "http://schacon.github.com/git/gittutorial.html"><kbd>man
  gittutorial</kbd></a>. Again - note that all your changes using
  this syntax are local and you don't need to worry out them
  affecting other students.</p>

  <p>In this and future labs you will progressively build up your
  kernel. We will also provide you with some additional source. To
  fetch that source, use Git to commit changes you've made since
  handing in lab 1 (if any), fetch the latest version of the course
  repository, and then create a local branch called <tt>lab2</tt>
  based on our lab2 branch, <tt>origin/lab2</tt>:</p>
  <pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
# On branch lab1
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   lab1-questionary.txt
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   kern/kdebug.c
#       modified:   kern/monitor.c
#       modified:   lib/printfmt.c
#
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'</kbd>

 create mode 100644 lab1-questionary.txt
$ <kbd>git pull</kbd>
From http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~cs236376/jos
 * [new branch]      lab2       -&gt; origin/lab2
Already up-to-date.
$ <kbd>git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2</kbd>
Branch lab2 set up to track remote branch lab2 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'lab2'
</pre>

  <p>The <kbd>git checkout -b</kbd> command shown above actually does
  two things: it first creates a local branch <tt>lab2</tt> that is
  based on the <tt>origin/lab2</tt> branch provided by the course
  staff, and second, it changes the contents of your <tt>lab</tt>
  directory to reflect the files stored on the <tt>lab2</tt> branch.
  Git allows switching between existing branches using <kbd>git
  checkout <i>branch-name</i></kbd>, though you should commit any
  outstanding changes on one branch before switching to a different
  one.</p>

  <p>You will now need to merge the changes you made in your
  <tt>lab1</tt> branch into the <tt>lab2</tt> branch, as follows:</p>
  <pre>
$ <kbd>git merge lab1</kbd>
Merge made by recursive.
 kern/kdebug.c  |   11 +++++++++--
 kern/monitor.c |   19 +++++++++++++++++++
 lib/printfmt.c |    7 +++----
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
</pre>

  <p>In some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how to merge
  your changes with the new lab assignment (e.g. if you modified some
  of the code that is changed in the second lab assignment). In that
  case, the <kbd>git merge</kbd> command will tell you which files
  are <i>conflicted</i>, and you should first resolve the conflict
  (by editing the relevant files) and then commit the resulting files
  with <kbd>git commit -a</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Lab 2 contains the following new source files, which you should
  browse through:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt></li>

    <li><tt>kern/pmap.c</tt></li>

    <li><tt>kern/pmap.h</tt></li>

    <li><tt>kern/kclock.h</tt></li>

    <li><tt>kern/kclock.c</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p><tt>memlayout.h</tt> describes the layout of the virtual address
  space that you must implement by modifying <tt>pmap.c</tt>.
  <tt>memlayout.h</tt> and <tt>pmap.h</tt> define the
  <code>PageInfo</code> structure that you'll use to keep track of
  which pages of physical memory are free. <tt>kclock.c</tt> and
  <tt>kclock.h</tt> manipulate the PC's battery-backed clock and CMOS
  RAM hardware, in which the BIOS records the amount of physical
  memory the PC contains, among other things. The code in
  <tt>pmap.c</tt> needs to read this device hardware in order to
  figure out how much physical memory there is, but that part of the
  code is done for you: you do not need to know the details of how
  the CMOS hardware works.</p>

  <p>Pay particular attention to <tt>memlayout.h</tt> and
  <tt>pmap.h</tt>, since this lab requires you to use and understand
  many of the definitions they contain. You may want to review
  <tt>inc/mmu.h</tt>, too, as it also contains a number of
  definitions that will be useful for this lab.</p>
  
  <h3>JOS Physical Memory Detection</h3>

  <p> JOS sees only 64MB of RAM. For simplisity (probably), JOS
  use CMOS memory size registers to detect low (regs <samp>0x15</samp> and 
  <samp>0x16</samp>) and extended memory (regs <samp>0x17</samp> and 
  <samp>0x18</samp>) which are limited to 64MB (these registers report memory in KBs). 
  To detect memory above 64MB you may use registers <samp>0x34</samp> and 
  <samp>0x35</samp>. Pay attention, that these registers report memory
  in 64KB blocks. Just for the test (not required for the labs), 
  you can add following line to detect extended
  memory in your <samp>i386_detect_memory(void)</samp> function 
  (in <samp>kern/pmap.c</samp>):
  <pre>
  // Use CMOS calls to measure available base and extended memory. 
  // (CMOS calls return results in kilobytes.) 
  npages_basemem = (nvram_read(NVRAM_BASELO) * 1024) / PGSIZE;

  // reg 0x34 and 0x35 return results in 64KB 
  npages_extmem = ((nvram_read(0x34) << 16)) / PGSIZE; 
  </pre>
  
  You can read about bochs CMOS registers here <a href=
   "http://bochs.sourceforge.net/techspec/CMOS-reference.txt"> CMOS
   reference</a>, and here <a href=
  "http://wiki.osdev.org/CMOS#Memory_Size_Registers"> Memory Size
  Registers</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Lab Requirements</h3>

  <p>In this lab and subsequent labs, do all of the regular exercises
  described in the lab and <i>at least one</i> challenge problem.
  (Some challenge problems are more challenging than others, of
  course!) As usual, write the answers in the <a href=
  "lab2-questionary.txt">questionary</a>. This time include a short
  description of what you did to solve your chosen challenge problem
  (e.g., one or two paragraph). If you implement more than one
  challenge problem, you only need to describe one of them in the
  write-up, though of course you are welcome to do more.</p>

  <p>Strive to write clean, maintainable code. This includes wise use
  of functions and macros which are already defined. Sometimes it's
  much more easier to write the "raw" expression instead of
  "wrapping" it in the right macros/function calls. This is because
  you are not familiar with the source yet. Don't do it! Search
  through the code to find the most coherent way to express yourself.
  Gradually you'll know the source better and this task will be
  easier. You will appreciate it later, when you'll need to read your
  code or search through it. If you aren't convinced yet, look at it
  this way: if we decide to read your code, clean and nice code will
  make us happier than the ugly one, and happier homework checker
  leads to higher homework grade &#9786;.</p>

  <h3>Hand-In Procedure</h3>

  <p>When you are ready to hand in your lab (including the filled
  <a href=
  "lab2-questionary.txt"><samp>lab2-questionary.txt</samp></a>), run
  <kbd>make handin</kbd> in the source directory. This will make a
  tar file for you, which you can then submit via <a href=
  "http://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/236376/">webcourse site</a>.
  You can list the contents of the tar file with <kbd>tar -tvzf
  lab2-handin.tar.gz</kbd> or unpack it (in another directory) with
  <kbd>tar -xzf lab2-handin.tar.gz</kbd>.</p>

  <p>As before, we will be grading your solutions with a grading
  program. You can run <kbd>make grade</kbd> in the <tt>lab</tt>
  directory to test your kernel with the grading program (no test for
  the questionary is provided). The grading program may rely on some
  in-kernel code for the check. Needless to say, that altering this
  code or otherwise deceiving automatic testing is considered severe
  cheating.</p>

  <h2>Part 1: Physical Page Management</h2>

  <p>The operating system must keep track of which parts of physical
  RAM are free and which are currently in use. JOS manages the PC's
  physical memory with <i>page granularity</i> so that it can use the
  MMU to map and protect each piece of allocated memory.</p>

  <p>You'll now write the physical page allocator. It keeps track of
  which pages are free with a linked list of <code>struct
  PageInfo</code> objects, each corresponding to a physical page. You
  need to write the physical page allocator before you can write the
  rest of the virtual memory implementation, because your page table
  management code will need to allocate physical memory in which to
  store page tables.</p>

  <div class="required">
    <p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span> In the file
    <tt>kern/pmap.c</tt>, you must implement code for the following
    functions (probably in the order given).</p>

    <p><code>boot_alloc()</code><br>
    <code>mem_init()</code> (only up to the call to
    <code>check_page_free_list(1)</code>)<br>
    <code>page_init()</code><br>
    <code>page_alloc()</code><br>
    <code>page_free()</code></p>

    <p><code>check_page_free_list()</code> and
    <code>check_page_alloc()</code> test your physical page
    allocator. You should boot JOS and see whether
    <code>check_page_alloc()</code> reports success. Fix your code so
    that it passes. You may find it helpful to add your own
    <code>assert()</code>s to verify that your assumptions are
    correct.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This lab, like the other labs, will require you to do a bit of
  detective work to figure out exactly what you need to do. This
  assignment does not describe all the details of the code you'll
  have to add to JOS. Look for comments in the parts of the JOS
  source that you have to modify; those comments often contain
  specifications and hints. You will also need to look at related
  parts of JOS, at the Intel manuals, etc. You may also find it
  helpful to revisit parts of Computer Architecture (<a href=
  "http://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/234267/">234267 "MAMAS"</a>)

  lecture on virtual memory</a>, though it has more details than we
  need here.</p>


  <h2>Part 2: Virtual Memory</h2>

  <p>Before doing anything else, familiarize yourself with the x86's
  protected-mode memory management architecture: namely
  <i>segmentation</i> and <i>page translation</i>.</p>

  <div class="required">
    <p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span> Look at chapters 5 and
    6 of the <a href="../../readings/i386/toc.htm">Intel 80386
    Reference Manual</a>, if you haven't done so already. Read the
    sections about page translation and page-based protection closely
    (5.2 and 6.4). We recommend that you also skim the sections about
    segmentation; while JOS uses paging for virtual memory and
    protection, segment translation and segment-based protection
    cannot be disabled on the x86, so you will need a basic
    understanding of it.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Virtual, Linear, and Physical Addresses</h3>

  <p>In x86 terminology, a <i>virtual address</i> consists of a
  segment selector and an offset within the segment. A <i>linear
  address</i> is what you get after segment translation but before
  page translation. A <i>physical address</i> is what you finally get
  after both segment and page translation and what ultimately goes
  out on the hardware bus to your RAM.</p>

  <div class="c2">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>
           Selector  +--------------+         +-----------+
          ----------&gt;|              |         |           |
                     | Segmentation |         |  Paging   |
Software             |              |--------&gt;|           |----------&gt;  RAM
            Offset   |  Mechanism   |         | Mechanism |
          ----------&gt;|              |         |           |
                     +--------------+         +-----------+
            Virtual                   Linear                Physical
</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>A C pointer is the "offset" component of the virtual address. In
  <tt>boot/boot.S</tt>, we installed a Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
  that effectively disabled segment translation by setting all
  segment base addresses to 0 and limits to <code>0xffffffff</code>.
  Hence the "selector" has no effect and the linear address always
  equals the offset of the virtual address. In lab 3, we'll have to
  interact a little more with segmentation to set up privilege
  levels, but as for memory translation, we can ignore segmentation
  throughout the JOS labs and focus solely on page translation.</p>

  <p>Recall that in part 3 of lab 1, we installed a simple page table
  so that the kernel could run at its link address of 0xf0100000,
  even though it is actually loaded in physical memory just above the
  ROM BIOS at 0x00100000. This page table mapped only 4MB of memory.
  In the virtual memory layout you are going to set up for JOS in
  this lab, we'll expand this to map the first 256MB of physical
  memory starting at virtual address 0xf0000000 and to map a number
  of other regions of virtual memory.</p>

  <div class="required">
    <p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span> While GDB can only
    access QEMU's memory by virtual address, it's often useful to be
    able to inspect physical memory while setting up virtual memory.
    Review the QEMU <a href="../../labguide.html#qemu">monitor
    commands</a> from the lab tools guide, especially the <tt>xp</tt>
    command, which lets you inspect physical memory. To access the
    QEMU monitor, press <kbd>Ctrl-a c</kbd> in the terminal (the same
    binding returns to the serial console).</p>

    <p>Use the <kbd>xp</kbd> command in the QEMU monitor and the
    <kbd>x</kbd> command in GDB to inspect memory at corresponding
    physical and virtual addresses and make sure you see the same
    data.</p>

    <p>Our <a href="../../labguide.html#patched_qemu">patched version</a> 
    of QEMU provides an <kbd>info pg</kbd>
    command that may also prove useful: it shows a compact but
    detailed representation of the current page tables, including all
    mapped memory ranges, permissions, and flags. Stock QEMU also
    provides an <kbd>info mem</kbd> command that shows an overview of
    which ranges of virtual memory are mapped and with what
    permissions.</p>
  </div>

  <p>From code executing on the CPU, once we're in protected mode
  (which we entered first thing in <tt>boot/boot.S</tt>), there's no
  way to directly use a linear or physical address. <i>All</i> memory
  references are interpreted as virtual addresses and translated by
  the MMU, which means all pointers in C are virtual addresses.</p>

  <p>The JOS kernel often needs to manipulate addresses as opaque
  values or as integers, without dereferencing them, for example in
  the physical memory allocator. Sometimes these are virtual
  addresses, and sometimes they are physical addresses. To help
  document the code, the JOS source distinguishes the two cases: the
  type <code>uintptr_t</code> represents opaque virtual addresses,
  and <code>physaddr_t</code> represents physical addresses. Both
  these types are really just synonyms for 32-bit integers
  (<code>uint32_t</code>), so the compiler won't stop you from
  assigning one type to another! Since they are integer types (not
  pointers), the compiler <i>will</i> complain if you try to
  dereference them.</p>

  <p>The JOS kernel can dereference a <code>uintptr_t</code> by first
  casting it to a pointer type. In contrast, the kernel can't
  sensibly dereference a physical address, since the MMU translates
  all memory references. If you cast a <code>physaddr_t</code> to a
  pointer and dereference it, you may be able to load and store to
  the resulting address (the hardware will interpret it as a virtual
  address), but you probably won't get the memory location you
  intended.</p>

  <p>To summarize:</p>

  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <th>C type</th>

      <th>Address type</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>T*</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td>Virtual</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>uintptr_t</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td>Virtual</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>physaddr_t</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td>Physical</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <div class="question">
    <p><span class="header">Question</span></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct,
      what type should variable <code>x</code> have,
      <code>uintptr_t</code> or <code>physaddr_t</code>?
        <pre>
        <i>mystery_t</i> x;
        char* value = return_a_pointer();
        *value = 10;
        x = (<i>mystery_t</i>) value;
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>The JOS kernel sometimes needs to read or modify memory for
  which it knows only the physical address. For example, adding a
  mapping to a page table may require allocating physical memory to
  store a page directory and then initializing that memory. However,
  the kernel, like any other software, cannot bypass virtual memory
  translation and thus cannot directly load and store to physical
  addresses. One reason JOS remaps of all of physical memory starting
  from physical address 0 at virtual address 0xf0000000 is to help
  the kernel read and write memory for which it knows just the
  physical address. In order to translate a physical address into a
  virtual address that the kernel can actually read and write, the
  kernel must add 0xf0000000 to the physical address to find its
  corresponding virtual address in the remapped region. You should
  use <code>KADDR(pa)</code> to do that addition.</p>

  <p>The JOS kernel also sometimes needs to be able to find a
  physical address given the virtual address of the memory in which a
  kernel data structure is stored. Kernel global variables and memory
  allocated by <code>boot_alloc()</code> are in the region where the
  kernel was loaded, starting at 0xf0000000, the very region where we
  mapped all of physical memory. Thus, to turn a virtual address in
  this region into a physical address, the kernel can simply subtract
  0xf0000000. You should use <code>PADDR(va)</code> to do that
  subtraction.</p>

  <h3>Reference counting</h3>

  <p>In future labs you will often have the same physical page mapped
  at multiple virtual addresses simultaneously (or in the address
  spaces of multiple environments). You will keep a count of the
  number of references to each physical page in the
  <code>pp_ref</code> field of the <code>struct PageInfo</code>
  corresponding to the physical page. When this count goes to zero
  for a physical page, that page can be freed because it is no longer
  used. In general, this count should equal to the number of times
  the physical page appears <em>below <code>UTOP</code></em> in all
  page tables (the mappings above <code>UTOP</code> are mostly set up
  at boot time by the kernel and should never be freed, so there's no
  need to reference count them). We'll also use it to keep track of
  the number of pointers we keep to the page directory pages and, in
  turn, of the number of references the page directories have to page
  table pages.</p>

  <p>Be careful when using <tt>page_alloc</tt>. The page it returns
  will always have a reference count of 0, so <tt>pp_ref</tt> should
  be incremented as soon as you've done something with the returned
  page (like inserting it into a page table). Sometimes this is
  handled by other functions (for example, <tt>page_insert</tt>) and
  sometimes the function calling <tt>page_alloc</tt> must do it
  directly.</p>

  <h3>Page Table Management</h3>

  <p>Now you'll write a set of routines to manage page tables: to
  insert and remove linear-to-physical mappings, and to create page
  table pages when needed.</p>

  <div class="required">
    <p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span> In the file
    <tt>kern/pmap.c</tt>, you must implement code for the following
    functions.</p>
    <pre>
        pgdir_walk()
        boot_map_region()
        page_lookup()
        page_remove()
        page_insert()
        
</pre>

    <p><code>check_page()</code>, called from
    <code>mem_init()</code>, tests your page table management
    routines. You should make sure it reports success before
    proceeding.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Part 3: Kernel Address Space</h2>

  <p>JOS divides the processor's 32-bit linear address space into two
  parts. User environments (processes), which we will begin loading
  and running in lab 3, will have control over the layout and
  contents of the lower part, while the kernel always maintains
  complete control over the upper part. The dividing line is defined
  somewhat arbitrarily by the symbol <code>ULIM</code> in
  <tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt>, reserving approximately 256MB of virtual
  address space for the kernel. This explains why we needed to give
  the kernel such a high link address in lab 1: otherwise there would
  not be enough room in the kernel's virtual address space to map in
  a user environment below it at the same time.</p>

  <p>You'll find it helpful to refer to the JOS memory layout diagram
  in <tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt> both for this part and for later
  labs.</p>

  <h3>Permissions and Fault Isolation</h3>

  <p>Since kernel and user memory are both present in each
  environment's address space, we will have to use permission bits in
  our x86 page tables to allow user code access only to the user part
  of the address space. Otherwise bugs in user code might overwrite
  kernel data, causing a crash or more subtle malfunction; user code
  might also be able to steal other environments' private data.</p>

  <p>The user environment will have no permission to any of the
  memory above <code>ULIM</code>, while the kernel will be able to
  read and write this memory. For the address range
  <code>[UTOP,ULIM)</code>, both the kernel and the user environment
  have the same permission: they can read but not write this address
  range. This range of address is used to expose certain kernel data
  structures read-only to the user environment. Lastly, the address
  space below <code>UTOP</code> is for the user environment to use;
  the user environment will set permissions for accessing this

  <h3>Initializing the Kernel Address Space</h3>

  <p>Now you'll set up the address space above <code>UTOP</code>: the
  kernel part of the address space. <tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt> shows
  the layout you should use. You'll use the functions you just wrote
  to set up the appropriate linear to physical mappings.</p>

      <li>We have placed the kernel and user environment in the same
      address space. Why will user programs not be able to read or
      write the kernel's memory? What specific mechanisms protect the
      kernel memory?</li>

      <li>What is the maximum amount of physical memory that this
      operating system can support? Why?</li>

      <li>How much space overhead is there for managing memory, if we
      actually had the maximum amount of physical memory? How is this
      overhead broken down?</li>

      <li> Revisit the page table setup in <tt>kern/entry.S</tt> and
      <tt>kern/entrypgdir.c</tt>.  Immediately after we turn on paging, 
      EIP is still a low number (a little over 1MB).  At what point do 
      we transition to running at an EIP above KERNBASE?  What makes it
      possible for us to continue executing at a low EIP between when we
      enable paging and when we begin running at an EIP above KERNBASE?
      Why is this transition necessary?</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="challenge">
    <p><span class="header">Challenge!</span> We consumed many
    physical pages to hold the page tables for the KERNBASE mapping.
    Do a more space-efficient job using the PTE_PS ("Page Size") bit
    in the page directory entries. This bit was <i>not</i> supported
    in the original 80386, but is supported on more recent x86
    processors. You will therefore have to refer to <a href=
    "../../readings/ia32/IA32-3A.pdf">Volume 3 of the current Intel
    manuals</a>. Make sure you design the kernel to use this
    optimization only on processors that support it!<br></p>
  </div>

  <div class="challenge">
    <p><span class="header">Challenge!</span> Extend the JOS kernel
    monitor with commands to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Display in a useful and easy-to-read format all of the
      physical page mappings (or lack thereof) that apply to a
      particular range of virtual/linear addresses in the currently
      active address space. For example, you might enter
      <tt>'showmappings 0x3000 0x5000'</tt> to display the physical
      page mappings and corresponding permission bits that apply to
      the pages at virtual addresses 0x3000, 0x4000, and 0x5000.</li>

      <li>Explicitly set, clear, or change the permissions of any
      mapping in the current address space.</li>

      <li>Dump the contents of a range of memory given either a
      virtual or physical address range. Be sure the dump code
      behaves correctly when the range extends across page
      boundaries!</li>

      <li>Do anything else that you think might be useful later for
      debugging the kernel. (There's a good chance it will be!)</li>

  <h3>Address Space Layout Alternatives</h3>

  <p>The address space layout we use in JOS is not the only one
  possible. An operating system might map the kernel at low linear
  addresses while leaving the <i>upper</i> part of the linear address
  space for user processes. x86 kernels generally do not take this
  approach, however, because one of the x86's backward-compatibility
  modes, known as <i>virtual 8086 mode</i>, is "hard-wired" in the
  processor to use the bottom part of the linear address space, and
  thus cannot be used at all if the kernel is mapped there.</p>

  <p>It is even possible, though much more difficult, to design the
  kernel so as not to have to reserve <i>any</i> fixed portion of the
  processor's linear or virtual address space for itself, but instead
  effectively to allow allow user-level processes unrestricted use of
  the <i>entire</i> 4GB of virtual address space - while still fully
  protecting the kernel from these processes and protecting different
  processes from each other!</p>

  <div class="challenge">
    <p><span class="header">Challenge!</span> Write up an outline of
    how a kernel could be designed to allow user environments
    unrestricted use of the full 4GB virtual and linear address
    space. Hint: the technique is sometimes known as "<i>follow the
    bouncing kernel</i>." In your design, be sure to address exactly
    what has to happen when the processor transitions between kernel
    and user modes, and how the kernel would accomplish such
    transitions. Also describe how the kernel would access physical
    memory and I/O devices in this scheme, and how the kernel would
    access a user environment's virtual address space during system
    calls and the like. Finally, think about and describe the
    advantages and disadvantages of such a scheme in terms of
    flexibility, performance, kernel complexity, and other factors
    you can think of.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="challenge">
    <p><span class="header">Challenge!</span> Since our JOS kernel's
    memory management system only allocates and frees memory on page
    granularity, we do not have anything comparable to a
    general-purpose <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> facility
    that we can use within the kernel. This could be a problem if we
    want to support certain types of I/O devices that require
    <i>physically contiguous</i> buffers larger than 4KB in size, or
    if we want user-level environments, and not just the kernel, to
    be able to allocate and map 4MB <i>superpages</i> for maximum
    processor efficiency. (See the earlier challenge problem about
    PTE_PS.)<br></p>

    <p>Generalize the kernel's memory allocation system to support
    pages of a variety of power-of-two allocation unit sizes from 4KB
    up to some reasonable maximum of your choice. Be sure you have
    some way to divide larger allocation units into smaller ones on
    demand, and to coalesce multiple small allocation units back into
    larger units when possible. Think about the issues that might
    arise in such a system.</p>
