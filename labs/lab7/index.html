  <h1>236376 OSE Lab 7: Final Project</h1>

  <dl class="publication">
    <dt>Due date:</dt>

    <dd>See Webcourse.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><span class="c1">Please note</span>: You should <b>not</b>
  publish your lab solutions in any publicly accessible site such as
  github.</p>

  <p>For the last part of the course you'll work on an operating
  systems project of your choice. The goal is to have fun and explore
  more advanced O/S topics; you don't have to do novel research.</p>

  <p>For the final project you have two options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Write network device driver for JOS -- do <a href=
    "../lab6/index.html">lab 6</a>. You are free, of course, to extend 
    lab 6, or any part of JOS, further in interesting ways.</li>

    <li>Work on a project of your choice that involves your JOS. This
    project must be of the same scope as lab 6 or larger.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We'll grade you on how much you got working, how elegant your
  design is, how well you can explain it, and how interesting and
  creative your solution is. We do realize that time is limited, so
  we don't expect you to re-write Linux by the end of the semester.
  Try to make sure your goals are reasonable; perhaps set a minimum
  goal that's definitely achievable and a more ambitious goal if
  things go well.</p>

  <h2>Deliverables</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Send your proposal to TA in charge, which should
    include:

      <ul>
        <li>The names and IDs of your group members.</li>

        <li>What did you choose to do (no more than a paragraph or
        two).</li>

        <li>What do you plan to present (list of
        deliverables).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Submit source code tar-ball along with a short
    write-up to the <a href=
    "http://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/236376/">webcourse site</a>.
    Put the write-up under the top-level source directory with the
    name "<tt>README.pdf</tt>" or "<tt>README.txt</tt>".</li>

    <li>Project demonstration.</li>

    <li> Be ready to demo the challenges during the project presentation. Backup video is encouraged to combat technical issues during the presentation. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ideas</h2>Here's a list of ideas to get you started thinking --
  but you should feel free to pursue your own ideas.

  <ul>
    <li>Build a virtual machine monitor that can run multiple guests
    (for example, multiple instances of JOS), using <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/readings/vt-overview-itj06.pdf">
    x86 VM support</a>.</li>

    <li>Do something useful with the x86 <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/readings/intel-txt-software-development-guide.pdf">
    Trusted Execution Technology</a>. For example, run applications
    without having to trust the kernel. <a href=
    "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12-final-51.pdf">
    Here</a> is a recent paper on this topic.</li>

    <li>Fix xv6 logging to support concurrent transactions, and
    generally have higher performance, perhaps taking ideas from
    Linux EXT3.</li>

    <li>Use file system ideas from <a href=
    "http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/papers/osdi94.pdf">Soft
    updates</a>, <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/readings/netapp_wafl.pdf">
    WAFL</a>, <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/readings/p102-konishi_nilfs.pdf">
    NILFS</a>, ZFS, or another advanced file system.</li>

    <li>Add snapshots to a file system, so that a user can look at
    the file system as it appeared at various points in the past.
    You'll probably want to use some kind of copy-on-write for disk
    storage to keep space consumption down.</li>

    <li>Implement <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/readings/mazieres-hotos6.pdf">
    capabilities</a> to provide fine-grained control over what
    privileges processes have.</li>

    <li>Build a <a href=
    "http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc469h/fall/handouts/nitzberg91.pdf">
    distributed shared memory</a> (DSM) system, so that you can run
    multi-threaded shared memory parallel programs on a cluster of
    machines, using paging to give the appearance of real shared
    memory. When a thread tries to access a page that's on another
    machine, the page fault will give the DSM system a chance to
    fetch the page over the network from whatever machine currently
    stores.</li>

    <li>Layer software <a href=
    "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garth/RAIDpaper/Patterson88.pdf">RAID-5</a>
    over an array of disks, to increase fault tolerance and
    performance.</li>

    <li>Allow processes to migrate from one machine to another over
    the network. You'll need to do something about the various pieces
    of a process's state, such as file descriptors.</li>

    <li>Implement <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">paging</a> to disk in JOS,
    so that processes can be bigger than RAM. Extend your pager with
    swapping.</li>

    <li>Implement <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadable_kernel_module">loadable
    kernel modules</a> to extend the JOS kernel to replace or extend
    subsystems of the JOS kernel. For example, make the file system a
    kernel module so that you can add a kernel module to read DOS
    file systems, or replace the JOS file system.</li>

    <li>Use <a href=
    "http://static.usenix.org/event/osdi06/tech/erlingsson.html">xfi</a>
    to sandbox code within a process.</li>

    <li>Implement ideas from the <a href=
    "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=224076">Exokernel papers</a>,
    (accessible from within the Technion) for example the packet
    filter.</li>

    <li>Find more inspiration in <a href=
    "http://faculty.washington.edu/simpeter/arrakis-tr.pdf">Arrakis</a>,
    OS that impements Exokenel ideas on modern hardware.</li>

    <li>Make JOS have soft real-time behavior. You will have to
    identify some application for which this is useful.</li>

    <li>Make JOS run on 64-bit CPUs. This includes redoing the
    virtual memory system to use 4-level pages tables. See <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/reference.html">reference
    page</a> for some documentation.</li>

    <li>Port (small part of) JOS to an ARM microprocessor. The <a href=
    "http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">osdev wiki</a> may be
    helpful.</li>

    <li>A window system for JOS, including graphics driver and mouse.
    See <a href=
    "http://technion-csl.github.io/ose/reference.html">reference
    page</a> for some documentation. <a href=
    "http://web.mit.edu/amdragon/www/pubs/sqrtx-6.828.html">sqrt(x)</a>
    is an example JOS window system (and writeup).</li>

    <li>Implement <a href=
    "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12-final-117.pdf">
    dune</a> to export privileged hardware instructions to user-space
    applications in JOS.</li>

    <li>Intel recently announced <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_Synchronization_Extensions">
    transactional memory support</a> for its upcoming processors.
    Implement support for Intel's TSX in the QEMU emulator. A
    follow-on project would be to explore the use of Intel TSX
    primitives in writing concurrent software, such as extending the
    JOS kernel to use transactional memory.</li>

    <li>Write a user-level debugger; add strace-like functionality;
    hardware register profiling (e.g. Oprofile); call-traces</li>
  </ul>
